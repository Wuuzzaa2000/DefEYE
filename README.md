# DefEYE

The @defichain light wallet is an outstanding app and I use it every day. Ether to send funds to @cakedefi, rebalance vaults, add / remove liquidity and swap between assets. Sometimes it takes a while to get a TX confirmed and you basically have to watch the screen all the time if you want to perform several tasks. 

So I asked a friend to develop a small app to monitor your wallet (over API) for newly confirmed  TX and send a notification (ring + vibration) if there is a new confirmed TX. I called it DefEYE.

Now I can perform a task and put the phone to the side and just wait for a ring to start with the next task. It's such a life saver and very fun to use.
